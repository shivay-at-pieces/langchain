        Thanks for your interest in LangChain 🦜️🔗!

        Please follow these instructions, fill every question, and do every step. 🙏
        
        We're asking for this because answering questions and solving problems in GitHub takes a lot of time --
        this is time that we cannot spend on adding new features, fixing bugs, writing documentation or reviewing pull requests.

        By asking questions in a structured way (following this) it will be much easier for us to help you.

        There's a high chance that by following this process, you'll find the solution on your own, eliminating the need to submit a question and wait for an answer. 😎

        As there are many questions submitted every day, we will **DISCARD** and close the incomplete ones. 
        
        That will allow us (and others) to focus on helping people like you that follow the whole process. 🤓

          * I already hit the "watch" button in this repository to receive notifications and I commit to help at least 2 people that ask questions in the future.
          * Once my question is answered, I will mark the answer as "accepted".

        Please add a self-contained, [minimal, reproducible, example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) with your use case.
        
        If a maintainer can copy it, run it, and see it right away, there's a much higher chance that you'll be able to get help.
        
        **Important!** 
        
        * Use code tags (e.g., ```python ... ```) to correctly [format your code](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting).
        * INCLUDE the language label (e.g. `python`) after the first three backticks to enable syntax highlighting. (e.g., ```python rather than ```).
        * Reduce your code to the minimum required to reproduce the issue if possible. This makes it much easier for others to help you.
        * Avoid screenshots when possible, as they are hard to read and (more importantly) don't allow others to copy-and-paste your code.

        Please share your system info with us. Do NOT skip this step and please don't trim
        the output. Most users don't include enough information here and it makes it harder
        for us to help you.
        
        Run the following command in your terminal and paste the output here:
        
        python -m langchain_core.sys_info
        
        or if you have an existing python interpreter running:
        
        from langchain_core import sys_info
        sys_info.print_sys_info()
        
        alternatively, put the entire output of `pip freeze` here.
